{% include _toc.html %}

```{r install-EML-package }
#install R EML tools
#library("devtools")
#install_github("ropensci/EML", build=FALSE, dependencies=c("DEPENDS", "IMPORTS"))

#call package
library("EML")

```

Next, read in the EML doc of interest. We are using data from the Harvard 
Forest LTER tower. This file documents multiple data products that can be downloaded.

```{r read-eml }
#import EML from Harvard Forest Met Data
obj <- eml_read("http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/data/eml/hf001.xml")

#view size of object
object.size(obj)
```

##Getting Started

An eml file seems to consist of

1. a **dataset** - this is similar to a NEON data product. A dataset may contain
one or more data tables associated with it that has different types of related
information. FOr the harvard data, we are looking at tower measurements, aggregated
at various time intervales (15 minute, daily, etc).
2. **data tables** these are the actual data that make up the dataset. At NEON
we call these sub products.

To begin, i'd like to quickly scan the EML file and understand the 
dataset and data table structure. Id like one output list that helps me understand
structure.



```{r EML-Structure }

#How many data tables are described / included in this dataset?
length(obj@dataset@dataTable)

#what are the names of those tables?
eml_get(obj,"csv_filepaths")


```

#view Attributes for a file of interest

I am interested in working with the monthly average-m csv. #4 in the list. 

I'd like to know the following

1. a list of fields (metrics measured or columns) contained in the file
2. i'd like to be able to query each column to determine attributes like units that
I will need to properly work with the data

The goal is moving towards a reproducible workflow.

```{r view-monthly-attrs }
#view metadata for the 4th data table which should be monthly average metric
obj@dataset@dataTable[[4]]

#is this the right data table? yes
obj@dataset@dataTable[[4]]@entityName

#what information does this data table contain?
obj@dataset@dataTable[[4]]@entityDescription

obj@dataset@dataTable[[4]]@physical

#view table id
obj@dataset@dataTable[[4]]@id

```

Next, id like a nice clean list of attribute names (column names) for just this
data table. i don't need all of the descriptive text just yet. Can i get that?

```{r view-attr-list }
#what are the attributes in the data?
obj@dataset@dataTable[[4]]@attributeList

#view one set of attributes - the first in the list
obj@dataset@dataTable[[4]]@attributeList@attribute[[1]]

#for date fields i'd like to know the format and the timezone
obj@dataset@dataTable[[4]]@attributeList@attribute[[1]]@measurementScale
obj@dataset@dataTable[[4]]@attributeList@attribute[[1]]@attributeName


#view second attribute in the list - airt
obj@dataset@dataTable[[4]]@attributeList@attribute[[2]]

#I am at the units with the string below
#phew - long. what i really want is to be able to grab the unit programmatically
obj@dataset@dataTable[[4]]@attributeList@attribute[[2]]@measurementScale

```


#View metadata for a column

Next, i'd like to be able to view the units or other attributes for a field that
i might need for processing. For example i need to know the timezone for these
data in order to convert to a time field.

how do i do that?

```{r view-units }

```




**NOTE:** The imported object is fairly large - especially considering the XML itself is
quite small.

We can view all EML attributes in YAML format too.
```{r view-XML-YAML, results="hide"}
#view all elements in YAML format
#note - i've hidden the output as it's too long
obj
```

I am not sure what the "attributelist" element returns. This is curious.

```{r eml-get }
#Get Attributes
#what is this returning?
eml_get(obj, "attributeList")

```

##What does eml_get do below? it seems to try to download everything.

It hung up my mac processing. Would like to know more. 

```{r download-data }
#download in all data that the eml references
#store it in a data.frame format
#dat <- eml_get(obj, "data.frame")

```

The code below works well.

```{r view-eml-content }
#view the contact name listed in the file
#this works well!
eml_get(obj,"contact")

#grab all keywords in the file
eml_get(obj,"keywords")

#figure out the extent & temporal coverage of the data
eml_get(obj,"coverage")

#view list of files that you can download as described in the EML object 
eml_get(obj,"csv_filepaths")
```

#get EML id?

```{r get-id}
#not sure what this ID is
eml_get(obj,"id")

#not sure what this is doing either.
eml = eml_read("knb-lter-hfr.205.4")

eml@dataset@dataTable[[1]]@attributeList@attribute[[2]]

obj@dataset@dataTable

```
