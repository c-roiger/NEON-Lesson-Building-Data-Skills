Several factors contributed to extreme flooding that occured in Boulder,
Colorado in 2013. In this lesson, we will explore and visualize the data of two 
key variables including:

* Precipitation (rainfall) data collected by ???NDCD?? 
* Stream discharge (or flow) that occured due to combination of the drought 
conditions and extreme rainfall.

## Data: Precipitation & Stream Discharge

The heavy **precipitation (rain)** that occurred in September 2013 drove the 
many of the flood impacts including increased **stream discharge (flow)**. In 
this lesson we will download, explore, and visualize the precipitation & stream 
discharge data collected during this time to better understand this important 
flood driver.

Where can we get data? 

The precipitation data are obtained through 
 <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">NOAA's National Centers for 
Environmental Information</a> 
(formerly the National Climatic Data Center). There are numerous climatic data
sets that can be searched and downloaded via the 
<a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search" target="_blank">Climate Data
Online Search portal</a>. 

https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/cooperative-observer-network-coop

## Obtaining the Data

The precipitation data that we will use is from the 
<a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/cooperative-observer-network-coop" target="_blank">Cooperative Observer Network (COOP)</a>. 


> "Through the National Weather Service (NWS) Cooperative Observer Program
(COOP), more than 10,000 volunteers take daily weather observations at National 
Parks, seashores, mountaintops, and farms as well as in urban and suburban 
areas. COOP data usually consist of daily maximum and minimum temperatures, 
snowfall, and 24-hour precipitation totals." 
> Quoted from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information

Data is collected at different stations, often on paper data sheets like below,
and then entered into a central database where we can access that data and 
download in the .csv (Comma Seperated Values) format.

   data for the Cooperative Observer Network. Source: Cooperative Observer 
   Network, NOAA
   </figcaption>
</figure>

To obtain data we must first choose a location from which we want to get data. 
The COOP site Boulder 2 (Station ID:050843) is centrally located in Boulder, CO. 

 <figure>

   <figcaption> Cooperative Observer Network station 050843 is located in 
   central Boulder, CO. Source: National Centers for Environmental Information 
   </figcaption>
</figure>

Then we must decide what type of data we want. In the image below, we selected 
the desired date range, the type of dataset ("Precipitation Hourly"), and the
station located in central Boulder, CO.

</figure>

The data can then be downloaded as a .csv file which we will use to conduct our
analyses. 

## R Libraries

We will be working with time-series data in this lesson so we will load the
`lubridate` library. We will use `ggplot2` to efficiently plot our data and 
`plotly` to create interactive plots.

```{r load-libraries}

library(lubridate) # work with time series data
library(plyr) # allow for manipulation of data frames
library(ggplot2) # create efficient, professional plots
library(plotly) # create cool interactive plots

```

# Import Precipitation Data

We will use the `050843-Preciptation_Daily_2003-2013.csv` file
in this analysis. This dataset is the daily precipitation date from the COOP 
station 050843 in Boulder, CO for 1 Janurary 2003 through 31 December 2013. 

As the data format is a .csv, we can use `read.csv` to import the data. After
we import the data, let's have a look at the first few lines using `head()`, 
which defaults to the first 6 rows, of the `data.frame`. Finally, we can explore
the R object structure.

```{r import-precip }

#import precip data into R data.frame
precip.boulder <- read.csv("precip-discharge/050843-Preciptation_Daily_2003-2013.csv",
                           stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                           header = TRUE)
#view first 6 lines of the data
head(precip.boulder)

#view structure of data
str(precip.boulder)

```

# About the Data 
Viewing the structure of these data, we can see that a few potential issues with
the data. 

* **STATION** and **STATION_NAME**: Identification of the COOP station.
* **ELEVATION, LATITUDE** and **LONGITUDE**: The spatial location of the station.
* **DATE**: Which date the data is from. Notice that DATE is currently `chr`, 
meaning the data is interpreted as a character class and not as a date. 
* **HPCP**: The total precipitation given in **hundredths of an inch**, recorded
for the hour ending at the time specified by DATE. Importantly, the metadata 
(see below) notes that the value 99999 indicates missing data. Also important, 
hours with no precipitation are not recorded. 

Additional information about the data, known as metadata, is available in the 
`PRECIP_HLY_documentation_Metadata.doc` file, which is originally downloaded 
from 
<a href="http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cdo/documentation/PRECIP_HLY_documentation.doc" target="_blank">COOP documentation</a>.

## Clean the Data
As we've noted date field is in a character class, we can convert it to a 
date class using `as.POSIXct()`. 

* For more information on date/time classes, see the NEON tutorial 
[Dealing With Dates & Times in R - as.Date, POSIXct, POSIXlt ]({{ site.baseurl }}/R/time-series-convert-date-time-class-POSIX/).

```{r convert-date}

# convert date time
precip.boulder$DateTime <- as.POSIXct(precip.boulder$DATE, 
                                  format="%Y%m%d %H:%M") 
                                  #Date in the format: YearMonthDay Hour:Minute 

# double check structure
str(precip.boulder)

```

We've also learned that missing values are labelled `99999`. If we do not 
identify `99999` as a NoData or NA value, it will be interpreted as nearly 
100 inches of rain (99999/100ths)!

``` {r no-data-values}

# clean up no data values
precip.boulder$HPCP[precip.boulder$HPCP==99999] <- NA

# check that NA values were added; 
# we can do this by finding the sum of how many NA values there are
sum(is.na(precip.boulder))

```

In addition, we rarely think about rain in 100th of an inch. Let's convert 
`HPCP` to inches and create a new column `PRECIP` with that data.  

``` {r inches}

# convert from 100th inch by dividing by 100
precip.boulder$PRECIP<-precip.boulder$HPCP/100

# view & check to make sure conversion occured
head(precip.boulder)

```

## Plot Precipitation Data
Now that we've cleaned up the data let's view it. To do this we will plot using 
`ggplot()` from the `ggplot2` package. 

``` {r plot-precip-hourly}
#plot the data
precPlot_hourly <- ggplot(data=precip.boulder,  # the data frame
      aes(DATE, PRECIP)) +   # the variables of interest
      geom_bar(stat="identity") +   # create a bar graph
      scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 10)) +  # set the y limits of the plot
      xlab("Date") + ylab("Precipitation (Inches)") +  # label the x & y axes
      ggtitle("Hourly Precipitation - Boulder Station\n 2003-2013")  # add a title

precPlot_hourly

```

As we can see, plotting hourly date leads to very small numbers and is difficult
to represent all information on a figure. Plots and comparison of daily 
precipitation would be easier to view. 

```{r daily-summaries }

# convert DATE to a Date class 
# (this will strip the time, but that is saved in DateTime)
precip.boulder$DATE <- as.Date(precip.boulder$DATE, # convert to Date class
                                  format="%Y%m%d %H:%M") 
                                  #Date in the format: YearMonthDay Hour:Minute 

# double check conversion
str(precip.boulder)

# aggregate the Precipitation (PRECIP) data by DATE
precip.boulder_daily <-aggregate(precip.boulder$PRECIP,   # data to aggregate
																 by=list(precip.boulder$DATE),  # variable to aggregate by
																 FUN=sum,   # take the sum (total) of the precip
																 na.rm=TRUE)  # if the are NA values ignore them
												# if this is FALSE any NA value will prevent a value be totalled

# view the results
head(precip.boulder_daily)

# rename the columns
names(precip.boulder_daily)[names(precip.boulder_daily)=="Group.1"] <- "DATE"
names(precip.boulder_daily)[names(precip.boulder_daily)=="x"] <- "PRECIP"

# double check rename
names(precip.boulder_daily)

# now lets plot the data again
precPlot_daily <- ggplot(data=precip.boulder_daily,  # the data frame
      aes(DATE, PRECIP)) +   # the variables of interest
      geom_bar(stat="identity") +   # create a bar graph
      scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 10)) +  # set the y limits of the plot
      xlab("Date") + ylab("Precipitation (Inches)") +  # label the x & y axes
      ggtitle("Daily Precipitation - Boulder Station\n 2003-2013")  # add a title

precPlot_daily
```

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **R Tip:** This manipulation or aggregation of data
can also be done with the package `plyr` using the `summarize()` function.
{: .notice}

## Subset Data 

Instead of looking at the data for the full decade, let's now focus on just the
2 months sorronding the flood on 11-15 September. We'll use the window from 15 
August to 15 October to focus on. 

``` {r subset-Aug-Oct-2013}
#set limits for just the 2 months around the floods
limits <- as.Date(c("2013-08-15", "2013-10-15"))

#plot the data - Flood Time Period
precPlot_flood <- ggplot(data=precip.boulder_daily,
      aes(DATE, PRECIP)) +
      geom_bar(stat="identity") +
      scale_x_date(limits=limits) +
      scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 10)) +
      xlab("Date") + ylab("Precipitation (Inches)") +
      ggtitle("Precipitation - Boulder Station\n August 15 - October 15, 2013")

precPlot_flood

```

#Interactive Plots - Plot.ly

Let's turn our plot into an interactive plot.ly plot

```{r plotly-precip-data }

# load needed package if not already loaded
# library(plotly)

#setup your plot.ly credentials
Sys.setenv("plotly_username"="your.user.name.here")
Sys.setenv("plotly_api_key"="your.key.here")

#subset out some of the data - July-November
dailyPrec.sub <- subset(precip.boulder_daily.cln, 
                        day >= as.POSIXct('2013-08-15 00:00',
                        tz = "America/New_York") & day <=
        as.POSIXct('2013-10-15 23:59', tz = "America/Denver"))


#create new plot
new <- ggplot(data=dailyPrec.sub, aes(day,prec_in)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  xlab("Time") + ylab("Precipitation (inches)") +
  ggtitle("Daily Total Precipitation (Inches) - Boulder Creek 2013") 

#view plotly plot in R
ggplotly()

#publish plotly plot to your plot.ly online account when you are happy with it
plotly_POST(new)


```

#About the Data - USGS Stream Discharge Data

The USGS has a distributed network of aquatic sensors located in streams across
the United States. These network monitors a suit of variables that are important
to stream morphology and health. One of the metrics that this sensor network
monitors is **Stream Discharge**, a metric which quantifies the volume of water
moving down a stream. Discharge is an ideal metric to quantify flow, which
increases significantly during a flood event.

> As defined by USGS: Discharge is the volume of water moving down a stream or 
> river per unit of time, 
> commonly expressed in cubic feet per second or gallons per day. In general, 
> river discharge is computed by multiplying the area of water in a channel
> cross 
> section by the average velocity of the water in that cross section.

## Getting USGS Stream Gauge Data

For this lesson, we are using data collected by USGS stream guage 06730200 which
is located in Boulder Creek at North 75th St. This guage is one of the few the 
was able to collect data throughout the 2013 Boulder Floods. The data were that 
we will use were downloaded from USGS's 
<a href="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis" target="_blank"> National 
Water Information System portal </a>.

You can access these data and the full available data stream for the boulder 
guage using the link below. Notice that youare able to download the data at 
different time periods as well!

#Import USGS Stream Discharge Data Into R
Now that we better understand the data that we will work with, let's import it into
`R`. First, open up the `precip-discharge/2013-discharge.txt` file in a text editor.
What do you notice about the structure of the file?

The first 25 lines are descriptive text and not actual data. Also notice that 
this file is separated by tabs, not commas. We will need to specify the **Tab delimiter**
when we import our data.We will use the `read.csv` to import it into an `R` object. 

When we use `csv` we need to define several attributes of the file including:

1. The data are tab delimited. We will this tell R to use the `"/t"` **sep**arator. 
Which defines a tab delimited separation.
2. The first group of lines in the file are not data, we will tell `R` to skip
those lines when it imports the data using `skip=25`.
3. Our data have a header, which is similar to column names in a spreadsheet. We 
will tell `R` to set `header=TRUE` to ensure the headers are imported as column
names rather than data values.
4. Finally we will set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` to ensure our data come in a 
individual values.

Let's import our data.

## Import Stream Discharge Data
```{r import-discharge-2 }
#SOURCE
#http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/co/nwis/uv/?cb_00065=on&cb_00060=on&format=rdb&site_no=06730200&period=&begin_date=2013-01-01&end_date=2013-12-31
#import data

discharge <- read.csv("precip-discharge/2013-discharge.txt",
                      sep="\t",
                      skip=25,
                      header=TRUE,
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#view first few lines
head(discharge)


```

When we import these data, it appears as if we have 2 header rows rather than
one. Let's create a new `R` object that removes the second row of header values.
To do this, we can use select all data beginning at row 2 and ending at the
total number or rows in the file. The `nrow` function will count the total
number of rows in the object.

# LINK OUT TO DATA OR SOFTWARE CARPENTRY LESSONS THAT TEACH THIS??
* More on selecting a subset of a data.frame in R



Let's subset our `discharge` object to remove the first row.

```{r remove-second-header }
#how many rows are in the R object
nrow(discharge)

#remove the first line from the data frame (which is a second list of headers)
#the code below selects all rows beginning at row 2 and ending at the total
#number of rows. 
boulderStrDis.2013 <- discharge[2:nrow(discharge),]
```

Now, we have an `R` object that contains only rows containing data values. Each 
column also has a unique column name. However the column names may not be descriptive
enough. In some cases, when we had useful metadata, we might keep the names as is.
In this case, let's rename column 5, which contains the discharge value, **disValue**
so it is more "human readable" as we work with it in `R`.

```{r rename-headers }

#view names
names(boulderStrDis.2013)

#rename the fifth column to disValue representing discharge value
names(boulderStrDis.2013)[5] <- "disValue"

#view names
names(boulderStrDis.2013)

```

#View Data Structure
Let's have a look at the structure of our data. It appears as if the discharge 
value is a `character` class. This is likely because we had an additional row in our
data. Let's convert the discharge column to a `numeric` class. In this case, we can 
reassign that column to be of class: `integer` given there are no decimal places.

```{r adjust-data-structure }
#view structure of data
str(boulderStrDis.2013)

#view class of the disValue column
class(boulderStrDis.2013$disValue)

#convert column to integer
boulderStrDis.2013$disValue <- as.integer(boulderStrDis.2013$disValue)

class(boulderStrDis.2013$disValue)
str(boulderStrDis.2013)

```


#Converting Time Stamps
We have converted our discharge data to an `integer` class However the time stamp
field, `datetime` is still a `character` class. We could try to plot the data however, 
if we do, it will confuse R. It will read in the dates as character strings and
get confused. Your plot will take a LONG time to render!


```{r plot-flood-data-example, echo=FALSE }
#this plot takes FOREVER to create with all of the rows, so we will just 
#show them the output. OTherwise it could hang up machines.
ggplot(boulderStrDis.2013, aes(datetime, disValue)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Plot Data With Time Field as a Character Class\nNotice the X Axis Labels") +
  xlab("Date Time (Character Class)") + ylab("Discharge (CFS)")

```

To efficiently plot time series data, let's convert the `datetime` column to a 
`time` class for efficient plotting and analysis.

```{r convert-time }
#view class
class(boulderStrDis.2013$datetime)

#convert to date/time class - POSIX
boulderStrDis.2013$datetime <- as.POSIXct(boulderStrDis.2013$datetime)

#recheck data structure
str(boulderStrDis.2013)

```

#No Data Values
Next, let's query our data to check whether there are no data values (`NA`) in it.


```{r no-data-values }
#make sure there are no null values in our datetime field
sum(is.na(boulderStrDis.2013$datetime ))

```

#Plot The Data
Finally, we are ready to plot our data. We will use `GGPLOT` to create our plot.

```{r plot-flood-data }

ggplot(boulderStrDis.2013, aes(datetime, disValue)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Stream Discharge (CFS) for Boulder Creek\nJan. 2013-Jan. 2014") +
  xlab("Date (POSIX Time Class)") + ylab("Discharge (Cubic Feet per Second)")

```

#Plot Data Time Subsets With ggplot 

We can plot a subset of our data using `ggplot`. Let's plot data for the months 
directly around the boulder flood: August 2013 - October 2013.

```{r define-time-subset }

#Define Start and end times for the subset as R objects that are the time class
startTime <- as.POSIXct("2013-08-15 00:00:00")
endTime <- as.POSIXct("2013-10-15 00:00:00")

#create a start and end time R object
start.end <- c(startTime,endTime)
start.end
```

## Plot A Temporal Subset

Finally, we can use GGPLOT just like we did above to create a new plot. However, 
this time, we will use the `scale_x_datetime` method and define the limits to our
`limits` object.


ggtitle("Stream Discharge (CFS) for Boulder Creek\nJan. 2013-Jan. 2014") +
  xlab("Date") + ylab("Discharge (Cubic Feet per Second")
  
```{r plot-subset }
#plot the data - September-October
ggplot(data=boulderStrDis.2013,
      aes(datetime,disValue)) +
      geom_point() +
      scale_x_datetime(limits=start.end) +
      xlab("Date") + ylab("Discharge (Cubic Feet per Second)") +
      ggtitle("Stream Discharge (CFS) for Boulder Creek\nAugust 2013 - October 2013")


```

#Publish to Plot.ly
We have now successfully created a plot. We can turn that plot into an interactive
plot using `Plot.ly` if we want. Note, for this to be successful you need to 
set your Plot.ly API key which you will get from your free online account, once 
you create it.

Set your username: `Sys.setenv("plotly_username"="yourUserNameHere")`
Set your user key: `Sys.setenv("plotly_api_key"="yourUserKeyHere")`

##Time subsets in plot.ly

Note that plot.ly doesn't accept the ggplot time subset method. Thus we will
have to manually subset out our data.

```{r plotly-discharge-data, results="hide", eval=FALSE}
library(plotly)

#set username
Sys.setenv("plotly_username"="yourUserNameHere")
#set user key
Sys.setenv("plotly_api_key"="yourUserKeyHere")

#subset out some of the data - July-November
boulderStrDis.aug.oct2013 <- subset(boulderStrDis.2013, 
                        datetime >= as.POSIXct('2013-08-15 00:00',
                                              tz = "America/Denver") & 
                        datetime <= as.POSIXct('2013-10-15 23:59', 
                                              tz = "America/Denver"))

#plot the data - September-October
disPlot.plotly <- ggplot(data=boulderStrDis.aug.oct2013,
        aes(datetime,disValue)) +
        geom_point(size=3)
