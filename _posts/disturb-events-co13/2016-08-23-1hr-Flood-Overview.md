data that they use to study disturbance events. Further, it encourages students 
to think about why we need to quantify change and different types of data 
needed to quantify the change. This lesson focuses on flooding as a natural 
disturbance event with impacts on the local human populations. Specifically, it 
focuses on the causes and impacts of flooding that occurred in 2013 throughout 
Colorado with an emphasis on Boulder County."

## Lesson Overview for Instructors: 
This lesson demonstrates ways that society and scientists identify and use data 
to understand disturbance events. Further, it encourages students to think about 
why we need to quantify change and different types of data needed to quantify 
landscape change after a disturbance event. 

This lesson focuses on flooding as a natural disturbance event with impacts on 
humans. Specifically, it focuses on the drivers and impacts of flooding that 
occurred in September 2013 throughout Colorado with an emphasis on Boulder 
County. 

While the drivers and impacts of flooding extend beyond the metrics used in 
this lesson, we use these several datasets <LINK> to elicit discussion 
surrounding how we can study flooding and how the event impacts humans. 

* Precipitation: National Climatic Data Center–NOAA (LINK)
* Stream Discharge: USGS stream gauges (LINK)
* Before/After Terrain Data - NEON AOP LiDAR-derived Terrain Models (LINK)
* Before/After Imagery- various sources, each image has source information 

A brief lesson plan can be found here <LINK> and the more detailed lesson is 
posted here <LINK>. Additional information and supporting documents are found in
the XXX. 

## Lesson Goals 
Data must be collected repeatedly over time to quantify and study change in the 
environment.
Explore how data can be used to quantify the drivers and impacts of natural 
disturbance events and why the quantification is important to for society’s 
understanding of, forecasting of, and recovery from disturbance events. 
Introduce the drivers and impacts of a flood event.

### Science Objectives
After the lesson, students will be able to: 

* Explain how and why data are needed to support scientific inquiry.
* Summarize how data can be collected and used to quantify a flood event, 
including precipitation and stream gauges and LiDAR .
* Organize the various drivers and impacts of disturbance events to show 
causation. 
* Diagram relationships between different variables (drivers and impacts) and 
how they influence disturbance events.
Describe how disturbance events can impact society. 
Contrast how different types of data can be used to quantify changes in terrain. 
Summarize what LiDAR data are and several ways the data can be used.
Explain the concept of a “100-year event” and why we might have two 100-year floods five years apart.
Define: disturbance event, LiDAR, stream discharge (including CFS–cubic feet per second), and floodplain.

## Data & Coding Extensions
All data used in this activity are freely available (LINK to figshare account). 
The code for data manipulation and creation of the visuals is available (LINK 
to code folder?). Throughout the lesson these activities are listed as 
Optional Data Activity. This could be used in the classroom, in a lab, or an 
out-of-classroom setting for students already familiar with basic coding and 
working with data (e.g. graduate students in a cross-listed course). 

## Suggestions for Presenting Lesson
The detailed lesson is posted on the NEON Data Skills portal (LINK). The web 
page can be used directly to teach from, for students to follow along with the 
instructor, or to serve as a reference for students after the class. 
Instructors may also choose to download text, figures, graphics or video from 
this site and present the lesson in the medium of their choice. 

## Teaching Modules Collection
This lesson plan is part of larger collection of lessons utilizing data 
collected during the 2013 Colorado Floods that are designed for undergraduate 
and graduate students. All lessons and related materials can be found on the 
NEON Data Skills portal (www.neondataskills.org/teaching-modules/).
