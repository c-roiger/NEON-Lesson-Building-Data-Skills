<p>The electromagnetic spectrum is composed of thousands of bands representing different types of light energy. Imaging spectrometers break the electromagnetic spectrum into groups of bands that support classification of objects by their spectral properties on the earthâ€™s surface. Hyperspectral data consists of many bands - up to hundreds of bands - that cover the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
