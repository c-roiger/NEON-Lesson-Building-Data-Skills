Materials hosted on the NEON Data Skills portal have been developed and adapted
by many contributors.

## Tutorial Series

### Work with Spatio-temporal Data in R -- Data Theme: Phenology
The original materials were developed during a lesson building hack-a-thon 
jointly organized by Leah Wasser (NEON), Tracy Teal (Data Carpentry), Mike 
Smorul (National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) and Jason William
(iPlant Collaborative). 

Hack-a-thon participants included Mike Alonzo, 
Sean Barberie, Ben Best, Zack Bryn, Jonah Duckles, Marisa Guarinello, 
Jeff Hollister, Megan A. Jones, Matthew Kwit, Kristina Riemer, Dave Roberts, 
Keely Roth, Mike Smorul, Courtney Soderberg, Joseph Stachelek, 
Kaitlin Stack Whitney, Tracy Teal, Leah A. Wasser, Jason Williams, and 
Meg Williams.

The results of this collaboration are four tutorial 
series hosted on the NEON Data Skills portal (neondataskills.org) and also 
taught as Data Carpentry workshops (www.datacarpentry.org).  

* Introduction to Working With Spatio-Temporal Data and Data Management
